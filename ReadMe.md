I didn't made it alone, [Kakashi](@ApoorvSingal), [William](https://github.com/LucAngevare) and [Mr. Symbol](https://github.com/Symbolistic/) helped me with JavaScript (they did the whole JavaScript part of it) and I did the CSS. Hope you all will like it! please let me know what u all think about it.
